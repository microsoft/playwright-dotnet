A superset of the `key` values can be found here. Examples of the keys are:\n`F1` - `F12`, `Digit0`- `Digit9`, `KeyA`- `KeyZ`, `Backquote`, `Minus`, `Equal`, `Backslash`, `Backspace`, `Tab`, `Delete`, `Escape`, `ArrowDown`, `End`, `Enter`, `Home`, `Insert`, `PageDown`, `PageUp`, `ArrowRight`, `ArrowUp`, etc.\nFollowing modification shortcuts are also suported: `Shift`, `Control`, `Alt`, `Meta`, `ShiftLeft`.\nHolding down `Shift` will type the text that corresponds to the `key` in the upper case.\nIf `key` is a single character, it is case-sensitive, so the values `a` and `A` will generate different respective texts.\nShortcuts such as `key: \"Control+o\"` or `key: \"Control+Shift+T\"` are supported as well. When speficied with the modifier, modifier is pressed and being held while the subsequent key is being pressed.\n```js\nconst page = await browser.newPage();\nawait page.goto('https://keycode.info');\nawait page.press('body', 'A');\nawait page.screenshot({ path: 'A.png' });\nawait page.press('body', 'ArrowLeft');\nawait page.screenshot({ path: 'ArrowLeft.png' });\nawait page.press('body', 'Shift+O');\nawait page.screenshot({ path: 'O.png' });\nawait browser.close();\n```","returnComment":"","required":true,"args":{"selector":{"kind":"property","name":"selector","type":{"name":"string"},"comment":"A selector of an element to type into.
