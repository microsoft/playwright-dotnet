    "keywords": "How to get internal logs Contributors: Dario Kondratiuk Problem You need to get the internal log information to debug a problem. Solution Playwright Sharp uses a .NET Logger Factory to log the communication between the library and the playwright driver. It uses two categories: All the communication between the library and the driver is under the PlaywrightSharp.Transport.Connection category. The debug information coming from the driver, when debug: \"pw:api\" is set, is under the PlaywrightSharp.Playwright category. The debug argument is a shortcut to the DEBUG environment variable Playwright uses to setup its logging tool. You create an ILoggerFactory in the same way you would build a logger in ASP.NET. You can also use extension methods, like AddDebug to send the log in the output window, or AddConsole to send it to the console. ILoggerFactory loggerFactory = LoggerFactory.Create(builder => { builder.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Debug); builder.AddDebug(); builder.AddFilter((f, _) => f == \"PlaywrightSharp.Playwright\"); }); using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync(loggerFactory, debug: \"pw:api\"); The debug is only needed for the PlaywrightSharp.Playwright category. PlaywrightSharp.Transport.Connection logs will come with no extra argument."

    "keywords": "🎭 Playwright for .NET PlaywrightSharp is a .Net library to automate Chromium , Firefox and WebKit browsers with a single API. Playwright delivers automation that is ever-green , capable , reliable and fast . See how Playwright is better . Linux macOS Windows Chromium <!-- GEN:chromium-version --> 89.0.4344.0 <!-- GEN:stop --> ✅ ✅ ✅ WebKit 14.0 ✅ ✅ ✅ Firefox <!-- GEN:firefox-version --> 84.0b9 <!-- GEN:stop --> ✅ ✅ ✅ Headless execution is supported for all browsers on all platforms. Usage using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync(); await using var browser = await playwright.Chromium.LaunchAsync(); var page = await browser.NewPageAsync(); await page.GoToAsync(\"http://www.bing.com\"); await page.ScreenshotAsync(path: outputFile); Playwright Dependencies Playwright Sharp relies on two external components: The Playwright driver and the browsers. Playwright Driver Playwright drivers will be copied to the bin folder at build time. Nuget will rely on the RuntimeIdentifier to copy a platform-specific driver, or on the runtime used on dotnet publish . If the RuntimeIdentifier is not set, all runtimes will be copied inside a runtimes folder. Then, the platform-specific driver will be picked at run-time. Browsers The way browsers are installed will vary depending on the use case scenario. Playwright in test projects If you use Playwright in test projects, all required browsers will be installed at build time. Using Playwright in Docker If you use the official Docker images , all the required browsers will be installed in that image. The minor version of the package will tell you which docker image tag to use. For instance, PlaywrightSharp 0.162.0 will work with the tag v1.6.2 . Using Playwright in a Remote Server. If you run Playwright in a remote server. For instance, as part of a web application, you will need to run .\\bin\\playwright-cli.exe install in Windows or ./bin/playwright-cli install in OSX/Linux, as part of your deploy script. Other possible scenarios. If none of the scenarios mentioned above cover your scenario, you can install the browsers programmatically using await Playwright.InstallAsync(); Examples Mobile and geolocation This snippet emulates Mobile Safari on a device at a given geolocation, navigates to maps.google.com, performs an action, and takes a screenshot. using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync(); await using var browser = await playwright.Webkit.LaunchAsync(false); var contextOptions = playwright.Devices[\"iPhone 11 Pro\"].ToBrowserContextOptions(); contextOptions.Locale = \"en-US\"; contextOptions.Geolocation = new Geolocation { Longitude = 12.492507m, Latitude = 41.889938m }; contextOptions.Permissions = new[] { ContextPermission.Geolocation }; var context = await browser.NewContextAsync(contextOptions); var page = await context.NewPageAsync(); await page.GoToAsync(\"https://maps.google.com\"); page.ClickAsync(\"text='Your location'\"); // await page.ScreenshotAsync(\"colosseum-iphone.png\"); Evaluate in browser context This code snippet navigates to example.com in Firefox and executes a script in the page context. using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync(); await using var browser = await playwright.Firefox.LaunchAsync(); var context = await browser.NewContextAsync(); var page = await context.NewPageAsync(); await page.GoToAsync(\"https://www.example.com/\"); var dimensions = await page.EvaluateAsync<Size>(@\"() => { return { width: document.documentElement.clientWidth, height: document.documentElement.clientHeight, } }\"); Console.WriteLine(dimensions); Intercept network requests This code snippet sets up request routing for a WebKit page to log all network requests. using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync(); await using var browser = await playwright.Firefox.LaunchAsync(); var context = await browser.NewContextAsync(); var page = await context.NewPageAsync(); // Log and continue all network requests await page.RouteAsync(\"**\", (route, _) => { Console.WriteLine(route.Request.Url); route.ContinueAsync(); }); await page.GoToAsync(\"http://todomvc.com\"); Monthly reports October 2020 September 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 Useful links StackOverflow Issues"

The accessibility tree is used by assistive technology such as screen readers or switches. Accessibility is a very platform-specific thing. On different platforms, there are different screen readers that might have wildly different output. Blink - Chrome's rendering engine - has a concept of \"accessibility tree\", which is than translated into different platform-specific APIs. Accessibility namespace gives users access to the Blink Accessibility Tree. Most of the accessibility tree gets filtered out when converting from Blink AX Tree to Platform-specific AX-Tree or by assistive technologies themselves. By default, PlaywrightSharp tries to approximate this filtering, exposing only the \"interesting\" nodes of the tree. IBrowser A Browser is created when Playwright connects to a browser instance. IBrowserContext BrowserContexts provide a way to operate multiple independent browser sessions. If a IPage opens another page, e.g.with a window.open call, the popup will belong to the parent page's browser context. PlaywrightSharp allows creation of \"incognito\" browser contexts with NewContextAsync(BrowserContextOptions) method. \"Incognito\" browser contexts don't write any browsing data to disk. IBrowserType BrowserType provides methods to launch a specific browser instance or connect to an existing one. ICoverage Coverage gathers information about parts of JavaScript and CSS that were used by the page. IDialog IDialog objects are dispatched by page via the Dialog event. IElementHandle It represents an in-page DOM element. IEvent Events for WaitForEventAsync<T>(PlaywrightEvent<T>, Func<T, Boolean>, Nullable<Int32>) and WaitForEventAsync<T>(PlaywrightEvent<T>, Func<T, Boolean>, Nullable<Int32>) . IFrame At every point of time, page exposes its current frame tree via the MainFrame and ChildFrames methods. IJSHandle JSHandle represents an in-page JavaScript object. JSHandles can be created with the EvaluateHandleAsync(String, Object) method. IKeyboard Keyboard provides an api for managing a virtual keyboard. IMouse Provides methods to interact with the mouse. IPage Page provides methods to interact with a single tab or extension background page in Chromium. One Browser instance might have multiple Page instances. IPlaywright IPlaywright provides methods to interact with the playwright server. IRequest Whenever the page sends a request, the following events are emitted by an IPage . Request emitted when the request is issued by the page. IResponse Represents responses which are received by page. ITouchscreen The Touchscreen class operates in main-frame CSS pixels relative to the top-left corner of the viewport. Methods on the touchscreen can only be used in browser contexts that have been intialized with hasTouch set to true. IVideo When browser context is created with the videosPath option, each page has a video object associated with it. IWebSocket Represents websocket connections in the page.
