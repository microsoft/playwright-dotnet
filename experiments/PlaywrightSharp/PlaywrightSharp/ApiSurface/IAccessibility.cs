	/// The Accessibility class provides methods for inspecting Chromium's accessibility tree. The accessibility tree is used by
	/// assistive technology such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen readers</a> or 
	/// <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_access">switches</a>.
	/// Accessibility is a very platform-specific thing. On different platforms, there are different screen readers that might have
	/// wildly different output.
	/// Rendering engines of Chromium, Firefox and Webkit have a concept of "accessibility tree", which is then translated into different
	/// platform-specific APIs. Accessibility namespace gives access to this Accessibility Tree.
	/// Most of the accessibility tree gets filtered out when converting from internal browser AX Tree to Platform-specific AX-Tree
	/// or by assistive technologies themselves. By default, Playwright tries to approximate this filtering, exposing only the "interesting"
	/// nodes of the tree.
